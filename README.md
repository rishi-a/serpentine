`read-serial.py` Reads the serial port. For this to work, you will have to hook up _Serpentine_ via Arduino. This script is required to record the interaction and analyze it later.

`read-serial.ipynb` shows basic plot for the signal recorded from the sensor.

Folder `serpentine-arduino` consists of the Arduino code to read data from the sensor. Folder `Serpentine-Visual` consists of Processing code to visualise the soft switch input.
